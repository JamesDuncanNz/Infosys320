==========

The proposed system will initially be focused on the identification and mapping of PTA in kauri tress throughout
New Zealand. The user will use the system via a mobile application to identify and locate the infected trees. 
PTA is a tiny, fungus-like(water mould), plant pathogen that only affects kauri trees. In 2008 PTA was declared 
an unwanted organism, and in 2009 the New Zealand Government announced funding for a long-term management programme.
There are 3 main users of the system. The main initial users are the content creators who will contribute and add data 
to the system. The non-functional requirements that will be considered in the design and development of the system 
are that the system is to be secure and all user data is stored in an appropriate manner. The system needs to be
accessible by the users at all times, along with being highly reliable. The system also must be useable by the users,
is should have a clear and concise design with high functionality.

The System published here is a prototype of the database along with working tables and data. The UI will NOT look like
this in the final versions of the software. A mobile version will Also be Developed.
